    22 Beach Stories
</h1>
<p class ="project-description josefin-sans-paragraph"> 
    22 Beach Stories is a gift a friend for his 22nd birthday.
    <br>
    <br>
    The original idea was do design a logo including "22". A few days before I played GTA with my brother so this idea came out.
    <br>
    <br>
    There are five differents lightings corresponding to the differents states of the day. The late night one is my favorite tho.
    <br>
    <br>
    The foam of the waves are proceduraly generated according to the ditance from the shore. This was the most difficut to achieve.
    The rest was kinda done in a rush so the characters are also very simple. I tryed to cache the silouhette of the palm tree, even if they
    look quite simple. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I often have the impression on such scenes with large perspective that the few area that the background takes are the most important.
    You may have to just one a palm tree in front of the camera that takes the half of the screen but if the buildings in the background
    miss, the scene feeles easely unbalanced.
